# How a small investment gave me a taste of technology as it should be
I recently purchased a Raspberry Pi, after doing nearly nothing it with it for several months. I decided to put [raspbmc](http://www.raspbmc.com/) on it and start using it as my media center. Before that, I was using my gaming pc as media center. While it did work, the interface didn't translate well to a 40" screen from 4 meters away. 
The time it took from deciding to watch something (available on my hdd) to actually watching it with subtitles could take anywhere from 4 to 5 minutes. Entering my password, navigating to the correct folder, downloading the subtitles, extracting the subtitles, dragging the subtitles in my vlc window and finally starting to watch gave me a mental barrier to not start watching. 

## changing my ways
The first time I booted raspbmc I must say I really wasn't impressed. The interface looked okay, but it wasn't amazing. After plugging in my external hard drive my opinion started to change, the drive was automatically mounted. Which I didn't really expect because it is formatted as exfat, something that isn't natively supported by most linux distro's. I then linked several folders within the xbmc settings to start the process of indexing my tv shows & movies. Once again I was impressed, it indexed my folder of movies without a problem, I got a nice description with each movie and it seemed like it recognized all the movies without any work. With the TV shows however I wasn't impressed, it had indexed non of the tv shows. I googled my issue and soon found out that I had to use a specific naming convention, after doing that everything got indexed just fine. 

## navigation
At first I was using the excellent [yatse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree) android application, it allows me to completely control xbmc, but one day I noticed that when I switched to the specific hdmi source of the pi on my tv the name changed from _hdmi side_ to _xbmc_. I didn't think to much of it, because I knew that hdmi allows 2-way communication. Then later that day I tried to use the TV remote to alter some settings and noticed that xbmc responded! This blew my mind because this means I really have an integrated experience. After all these years of using my laptop to watch movies and tv shows because it was easier, now the raspberry pi with raspbmc really is the most efficient solution. I never expected that this &euro; 45 investment would be so much better then my &euro; 1000 pc.  
I can use the TV remote from my 40" sharp aquos to navigate (arrow buttons), play/pause/stop/rewind/fast forward and even enter text.  
Now I can go from deciding to watch something to actually watching something within a minute. This integration is what I wish all hardware had, but nearly none has. I find it amazing that this small level of integration adds so much more usability, but it seems no cable box I have ever used allows this, but a small cheap piece of hardware combined with an free operating system can.
