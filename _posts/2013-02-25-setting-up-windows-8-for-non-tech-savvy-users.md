### Windows 8
After installing & configuring Windows 8 on at least 20 pc's & laptops I now have a streamlined approach to setting up a fresh Windows 8 install
A lot of people believe Windows 8 is a terrible operating system. I can't agree. It's fast, looks good, has some great power user tools and seems to boot on just about any hardware made after 2005.
There are some downsides however.

## The good
- Booting windows 8 takes seconds, not minutes. This is due to some sneaky semi-hibernating which in itself is a good thing, but does present some issues because a "clean" boot isn't always a real clean boot.
- The new start-screen, with all of it's search options __rocks__.

## The bad
- The default settings make a lot of use of the metro-style applications. Which do not feature the common user interface elements that most Windows users have grown accustomed to.
- The games are gone (big deal for some people)
- The lock screen has no real purpose on desktop machines, it only delays login


# Installing software
I would advise using [http://www.ninite.com](ninite) to install the basic things like browser plug-ins, zipping tools, browsers, antivirus & office. My personal recommendation is to select the following: Chrome, Avira, 7-Zip, Java, Air, Shockwave, LibreOffice, Foxit Reader & TeamViewer (More on that later). The upside of using ninite is that you can save the installer and run it later to update all the packages (if you run it often, you won't even get those annoying pop-ups with updates available).
I believe that maybe 90% of the users won't need more software then these packages.

# Managing the start menu
The start menu should probably be kept as clean as possible, you probably don't need shortcuts to the (metro-styled) calendar & mail app.
The quick way to remove all the unnecessary apps is to right click them all and then select the __Unpin from Start__ option in the bottom of the screen. You should probably leave the Desktop shortcut on the start menu, I would even suggest leaving that one as the only option. That way, the user that logs in will only have the desktop option when logging in and will then be presented with the desktop environment.
