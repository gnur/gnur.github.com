### Windows 8
A lot of people believe Windows 8 is a terrible operating system. I can't agree. It's fast, looks good, has some great power user tools and seems to boot on just about any hardware made after 2005.
There are some downsides however.

## The good
- Booting windows 8 takes seconds, not minutes. This is due to some sneaky semi-hibernating which is really quite smart.
- The new start-screen, with all of it's search options __rocks__.
